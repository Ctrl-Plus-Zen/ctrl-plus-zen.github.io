Lucy's yoga journey began as a means to support her physical and mental health, and it became even more meaningful during her pregnancy. Her classes emphasize gentle movements, deep breathing, and relaxation techniques. These classes aim to reduce stress, enhance flexibility, and promote an overall sense of calm and well-being.
