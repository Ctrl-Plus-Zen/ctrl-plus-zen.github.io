From data crunching to mindful movement:  For seven years, Sam thrived as a data scientist. However, work's stress began to take a toll on his well-being.  A transformative yoga experience at Goodlife Gym sparked a passion that led him to complete a 200-hour training at Downward Dog Yoga Centre.  Sam's classes go beyond flexibility -  he emphasizes building strength and using breathwork to connect movement and posture.  In his classes, you'll find a focus zone where stress melts away and focus sharpens.
