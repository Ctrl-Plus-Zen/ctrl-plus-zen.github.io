## General Guidelines

### On-site
1. **Wear Comfortable Workout Clothing:** Please wear loose, comfortable clothing suitable for movement and stretching.
  
2. **Be Scent-Free:** Since breathing is an integral part of the class, we kindly request that you refrain from wearing strong scents.
   
3. **Ensure Uninterrupted Schedule and Environment:** Prioritize creating a peaceful, uninterrupted environment for your practice. Notify household members of your session to minimize distractions.
   
4. **Keep Phones and Laptops Away:** To maintain focus and respect for others, please keep electronic devices turned off and stored away during class.
   
5. **No Shoes on the Mat:** For hygiene and safety reasons, we ask that you remove your shoes before stepping onto the yoga mat. Practicing barefoot is recommended.
   
6. **Bring Your Own Mat and Props:** Feel free to bring your own yoga mat and any additional props you prefer. A water bottle and towel can also be helpful for hydration and comfort during practice.

### Live Virtual
In addition to the on-site guidelines:
1. **Ensure Adequate Space:** Make sure you have enough room to place your mat and fully extend your limbs without obstruction.
   
2. **Arrive Promptly:** Please join the virtual session on time to maximize your participation and respect the instructor's schedule and other participants' time.
